This is a test case for something tht puzzles me.

I want to be able to create an application that has a set of STI models.
I want to be able to create a select field with a choice of the types.
If I just use "Parent.subclasses_of(Parent)", it fails. If I use the
derived types, then use the same call, I see them.
This is probably something to do with lazy loading of models... maybe.
